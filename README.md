Surrogate-Shopper

This is an Android mobile app I built using Android Studio. It’s designed to connect volunteers with people who need help (whether it's shopping, running errands, or providing general support). The goal was to create a simple and practical solution that encourages community assistance.

This app was developed as part of a university coursework project to explore how mobile technology can be used to solve real-world problems, especially in areas like community support and communication.

On the backend, the app makes use of a MySQL database and PHP scripts to handle user registration, login, messaging, and request handling. All data is stored and retrieved from the server using SQL queries via HTTP requests. It does this using a university lamp server.

Just a quick note: since the app was developed specifically for Android, it can only be installed on Android devices. Also, it relies on a WITS-hosted server to connect to its database — which means the app will only function as long as that server remains up and running.

For a full walkthrough of how the app works, you can check out the video and PDF linked below. They cover everything in detail.
